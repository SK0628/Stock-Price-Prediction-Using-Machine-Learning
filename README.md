## 📈 Project Overview
Imagine you're an investor, constantly tracking stock prices, trying to predict the market's next big move. You analyze charts, follow news updates, and make decisions based on gut feeling. But what if you had a tool that could help you make data-driven decisions? That's exactly what this project aims to achieve!

This project implements a **real-time stock price prediction model** using machine learning techniques. It utilizes **Alpha Vantage API** to fetch stock data and applies **ARIMA modeling and sentiment analysis** to enhance prediction accuracy. The sentiment analysis is powered by **NewsAPI**, which gathers real-time financial news to assess market sentiment. The model is trained on **10 years of historical stock data** for a robust and reliable forecast.

## 🔥 Features
- 📊 **Real-time Stock Data**: Fetches stock prices using **Alpha Vantage API**
- 🧠 **Machine Learning Models**: Implements **ARIMA** for time series forecasting
- 💡 **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes news & social media sentiment for stock trends using **NewsAPI**
- 📅 **Long-term Data Training**: Uses **10 years** of stock market data
- ⚡ **High Accuracy Predictions**: Combines statistical and sentiment analysis models
- 📉 **Visualizations**: Generates interactive stock price trend graphs

## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Statsmodels)
- **Alpha Vantage API** (For real-time stock data)
- **NewsAPI** (For real-time sentiment analysis)
- **NLTK & VADER** (For sentiment processing)
